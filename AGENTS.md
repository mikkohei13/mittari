The purpose of this web app is to test new kind of statistics and visualizations before they are implemented into a production system. Therefore it does not need to be polished or production-ready.

Keep the app simple. Don't implement features that are not requested.

Avoid extensive error handling.

No fallback logic. No backwards compatibility.

api.laji.fi requires a token to be used. The token is stored in the .env file as LAJI_API_ACCESS_TOKEN.

The app is run locally with Docker and Docker Compose. Running it with plain Python will fail, so don't try that.

The production app is deployed to CSC OpenShift Rahti.

For important issues, ask for clarification or advice instead of making assumptions.

Don't do smoke tests unless requested.
